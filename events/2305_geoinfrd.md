# Why use CSC services?

* CSC specialist support
* “Outsource” heavy/specialized computations
* **Free of charge** for open science Finnish universities and research institutes

<br></br>
<div class="column">
**Compute & Analyze**

  - cPouta / ePouta / Rahti -> Cloud 
  - Puhti / Mahti / LUMI -> Supercomputers
  - CSC Notebooks
  - Sensitive Data (SD) services

<div class="column">
**Store, Share & Publish Data**

  * Allas -> Object storage
  * Fairdata
  * Paituli

# Why use CSC supercomputer?

When own computer is not enough:
<br><br>

* Resource needs (time (> 2 hours), memory (> 8 GB), storage (> 50GB), GPU)
* Prebuilt environments
* Run many experiments at same time
* Data availability
* Collaboration possibility

# Puhti, Mahti, LUMI ?

# Get access

Working at Finnish University / Univeristy of applied Sciences / state research institute? -> Free of charge
<br><br>

1. Create personal user account
2. Find a senior researcher / PI to create (a personal account for themselves and) and CSC project
3. Ask above person to add you to the project and add needed services
4. Read the documentation about the service in question: https://docs.csc.fi

# Challenges

<p align="center">

"`You can’t learn everything you need all at once.
Instead, continually learn and know when to ask for help.`"
